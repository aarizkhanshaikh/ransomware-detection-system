Phishing Email Analyzer
A desktop application built with Tkinter for analyzing email content and detecting potential phishing attempts. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to input email messages, analyze them using a simulated machine learning model, and display the confidence score, detected patterns, and recommendations.

Features
Intuitive User Interface: A clean and modern dark-themed interface built with Tkinter.

Background Model Loading: The machine learning model is loaded in a separate thread to ensure the UI remains responsive.

Real-time Analysis (Simulated): Provides immediate feedback on whether an email is classified as phishing or legitimate, along with a confidence score.

Pattern Detection: Identifies common phishing patterns (e.g., suspicious links, unusual sender).

Recommendations: Offers actionable advice based on the analysis result.

Input Validation: Ensures that the input content is valid and prevents analysis of code snippets or overly short texts.

Model Status Indicator: Displays the loading status and details of the simulated ML model.

Installation
To run this application, you need Python installed on your system.

Clone the repository (or download the script):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-email-analyzer.git
cd phishing-email-analyzer

(Note: Replace your-username/phishing-email-analyzer with the actual repository URL if you host it on GitHub.)

Install the required libraries:

pip install tkinter joblib

(Note: tkinter is usually included with Python installations. joblib is needed for loading ML models.)

Usage
Prepare your ML Model (Optional but Recommended):
The current application uses placeholder values for the ML model and TF-IDF vectorizer. To enable actual phishing detection, you will need to train your own model and save it using joblib.

Place your trained scikit-learn model (e.g., model.pkl) and TF-IDF vectorizer (e.g., tfidf_vectorizer.pkl) in the same directory as the phishing_detector.py script.

Uncomment and update the joblib.load lines in the load_ml_model method:

# In PhishingDetector class, load_ml_model method:
# self.model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
# self.tfidf_vectorizer = joblib.load('tfidf_vectorizer.pkl')

(Make sure the file paths are correct.)

Run the application:

python phishing_detector.py

Analyze Emails:

Once the application launches, wait for the "Loading ML Model..." message to disappear.

Enter the content of the email message you want to analyze into the "MESSAGE CONTENT" text area.

Click the "ANALYZE" button.

The results, including the detection status, confidence score, detected patterns, and recommendations, will be displayed.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Tkinter: For the graphical user interface.

joblib: (Placeholder) For saving and loading Python objects, typically used for machine learning models.

re (Regular Expressions): For input validation and pattern matching.

threading: For asynchronous model loading.

Future Improvements
Integrate a real machine learning model (e.g., pre-trained model or train one with a public dataset).

Add more sophisticated feature extraction for email content.

Implement a more robust logging system.

Allow users to load their own models.

Expand the pattern detection rules.

Add a history of analyzed emails.
